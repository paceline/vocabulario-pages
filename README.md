# Vocabulario Pages

This is the wiki part, extracted from the original [vocabulario](https://github.com/paceline/vocabulario) application, which I'm currently not able to maintain timewise. This is an attempt to keep the part I use the most and with the most valuable content accessible.

## Contribute

I'd love to hear from you if you found a bug or think I should add something. Or even better yet: [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) this project and make the corrections yourself :-)

## TODO

* Clean-up CSS formatting
