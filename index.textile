This is a small collection of language guides, mostly based on personal study notes. Maybe you'll find something useful for yourself here...

I'd love to hear from you if you found a bug or think I should add something. Or even better yet: <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo">Fork</a> the project on GitHub and make the corrections yourself :-)
